# ALGO Dashboard (Streamlit)

## Quickstart
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```
Open http://localhost:8501 in your browser.

## Notes
- The app reuses functions from `phase3_consolidator.py` (included in this folder).
- News sentiment is optional. If your environment doesn't have the extra libs from `news_analyzer (2).py`, the app will still work with a neutral summary.
